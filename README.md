# MyFirstMicrogame
Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: The game I created was a FPS (first person shooter) with several bosses and enemies. This game includes 2 different weapons, a laser gun and shotgun, has healing drops, and implements an ammo feature where you have to cool down your weapon every so often. Furthermore, this game features a health bar and a compass to ensure you know where all of the enemies are located. Finally, around the Map you'll notice several design/decoration features like crystals or the rocket, used to enhance the in game experience. 

Setup Instructions: How to open and run your game. 

Reflection: 50-100 words on what you learned, what worked well, and any challenges.
